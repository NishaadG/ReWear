# Problem 3: ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

## Problem Statement

Millions of people throw away clothing that could be reused or recycled, while many others lack access to affordable or appropriate clothing. ReWear bridges this gap by creating a community-driven clothing exchange platform where individuals can list, swap, or redeem clothes responsibly. The goal is to promote sustainability, reduce waste, and make fashion accessible to everyone.
